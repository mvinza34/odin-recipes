        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="content">
                <li>Mix yeast, water, and sugar in a glass or plastic bowl.</li>
                <li>Stir to dissolve the yeast and let the yeast "bloom" for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in 1 cup of flour, add salt, and then stir in another cup of flour.</li>
                <li>Dump the mixture onto the kneading board and add in the last cup of flour.</li>
                <li>Keep kneading until the dough is soft and elastic, and form the dough into a ball.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, pour in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and spread it around the bowl.</li>
                <li>Coat the ball of dough with the oil and cover the bowl with a damp towel.</li>

                <li>Punch down the dough and knead on the board for about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>To ensure that the crust won't stick, lightly spray the pizza pan with olive oil or vegetable oil spray and then work the dough to the pan.</li>
                <li>To make the tomato sauce, mix together the pureed tomatoes, tomato paste, minced garlic, and basil.</li>
                <li>Spread the sauce onto the prepared pizza dough.</li>
